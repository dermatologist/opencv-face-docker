# opencv-face-docker

This is a docker container with opencv and face recognition libraries installed with conda. This can be used as a base container for deploying prediction workflows. The pre-built container is available [on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/beapen/opencv-face) as beapen/opencv-face:latest

[Here is a OpenFaaS template](https://github.com/dermatologist/python3-ml) that uses this container as the base for easy serverless deployment. [Read more about OpenFaas](https://www.openfaas.com/).
